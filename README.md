ðŸ–± Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture

A computer visionâ€“based project that enables cursor control using real-time hand gestures instead of a physical mouse.
Developed using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, and NumPy.
Utilizes a webcam to detect and track hand landmarks for performing mouse operations.
Supports features like cursor movement, left click, right click, and scrolling through finger gestures.
Works efficiently in real-time, providing a smooth and touchless control experience.
Demonstrates the use of Computer Vision and Machine Learning in enhancing human-computer interaction.
Aims to provide a futuristic, contactless, and intelligent way to navigate digital systems.
